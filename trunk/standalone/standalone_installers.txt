# Each line is evaluated as a tuple by the build script.
#
# The second and fourth fields are always required. Most other fields are required if "Build Enterprise MSI" is true.
# When updating the version, update the second, third, and fourth  fields.
#
# The fields are:
#  * Friendly product name (required for MSI). Can include spaces, etc.
#  * Standalone installer exe name base (required) - everything but '.exe'.
#    * We recommend including the version of your app in the name so that it is
#      easy to differentiate different copies of the standalone installer. The
#      version properties of the standalone installer have Omaha's version, not
#      the app's, so the only way to determine the app version is to install it.
#  * Version of the app (required for MSI).
#  * List of (App Installer Location, App ID) tuples (required).
#  * MSI installer name base (required for MSI) - everything but '.msi'. Cannot change! Thus, should not include version info. Also, the resulting MSI must not be renamed.
#  * Custom tag parameters for MSI installer (optional). Example: '&brand=FOOB&ap=enterprise'
#  * Silent uninstall args (required for MSI). Args to add to the default uninstall command line to cause the uninstall to be silent.
#  * Whether to build an enterprise MSI - True/False.
#  * File Containing Tagging Info (optional)
