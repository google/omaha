## Introduction ##
Omaha, otherwise known as Google Update, is a program to install requested software and keep it up to date. So far, Omaha supports many Google products for Windows, including [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) and [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/), but there is no reason for it to only support Google products.

We know that keeping software updated is both important and hard, and so by open-sourcing this project, our hope is that perhaps we can help others solve this problem. So, if you'd like to get involved, or even use Omaha to support your own software projects, then just follow the instructions in the Getting Started guide below, and you'll be good to go!

## Getting Started ##
If you would just like to browse the source, you can do so [here](https://github.com/google/omaha).

However, if you'd like to contribute to the development of Omaha, there are much more detailed instructions in our [Developer Setup Guide](DeveloperSetupGuide.md) that you can follow to download and build Omaha.
